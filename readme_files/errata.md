## Errata for the first printing

### **In Chapter 2, pages 42-43, sidebar Code for fighting churn with data:**

*If you are using the code from github after September 2023, or the fightchurn pip package after 
version 1.1, the paths have changed from those described in the first printing.* 

In the first numbered list in the sidebar it should now read:

	2. Create a database schema with `fightchurn/churnsim/churndb.py`.
 	3. Generate simulation data and save it into the Postgres schema with 
       `fightchurn/churnsim/churnsim.py`.

In the command line example after the third paragraph it should now read:

​	`fightchurn/run_churn_listing.py --chapter 2 --listing 1`

In the second numbered listed in the sidebar it should now read:

	1. Create a schema with `fightchurn/churnsim/churndb.py`
 	2. ...
 	3. The listing wrapper program works from parameters stored in a JSON file, `fightchurn/listings/conf/churnsim_listings.json`.

### **In command line examples throughout the book:**

*If you are using the code from github after September 2021, or the fightchurn pip package, the paths have changed from those described in the first printing.* 

In the command line program examples it should read:

​	`fightchurn/run_churn_listing.py`
